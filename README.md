# Lights-Out
--Discription--

This is a kata I completed during my internship at Pixel.

Launch the app in simulator. It is compatable with most iOS device simulators but is untested on physical devices.

Recommend running on iPhone 7 iOS version 10.3

--How to Use--

The text fields at the top of the screen control the numeber of rows and columns presented to the user.

The switch at the bottom of the screen controls the pattern of dots the users toggles on and off.

Set the switch to "Single" for toggling individual dots, or "Plus" for toggling 5 dots at once.

Pressing the solve button will attempt to solve the board in its current configuration.
